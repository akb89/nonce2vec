# Experiments (2nd round)

Refctoring:
- window size = full sentence
- no window decay and sample decay (useless on nonces dataset anyway)
- fixed bug with alpha
- summing on whole context (not set of context)
- 'duran' nonce is tested twice in test set. We removed the second occurence

## Replication with AurÃ©lie's background model
with random subsampling (sum + train)
SUM: 0.00909 (no-reload) 0.02074657 (reload)
N2V: 0.00442 (no-reload)

with self filter:
SUM: 0.0276477 (with reload) 0.0141539 (no reload)
N2V:

no filter:
SUM: 0.00325612 (no-reload)
N2V:

## Filtering context
Filters:
1. No filter
2. Random filter
3. Self information filter
4. Context word entropy filter
