# Experiments

## Subsampling
We try and experiment with different kind of subsampling in sum-only mode on
the nonce definitional dataset.
1. Random subsampling
2. Self information with threshold at 22 (explain why)
3. Context informativeness > 0 (on a small window model and large window model)

```bash

```

| no filter | random | self 22 | CE > 0 (CBOW) | CE (BIDIR)
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | | |  |  |
